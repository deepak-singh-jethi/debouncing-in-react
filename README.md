# Debounce Example in React

This project demonstrates how to implement debouncing in a React application using functional components and hooks.

## Description

Debouncing is a technique used to limit the number of times a function is executed. It ensures that a function is only called after a certain amount of time has passed since it was last called. This is particularly useful for performance optimization when dealing with high-frequency events like user inputs.

This application captures user input in a text field and updates two values:
1. The immediate value (`value`) which reflects the current input value.
2. The debounced value (`debouncedValue`) which updates only after the user has stopped typing for a specified period (1 second in this case).

## Usage
```

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/deepak-singh-jethi/debouncing-in-react.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd debouncing-in-react
   ```
   
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5173) to view the application.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Tailwind css

## Project Structure

- **src/App.js**: Main React component implementing debouncing logic.
- **public/index.html**: HTML file where the React app is rendered.
